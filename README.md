# jellyfin-script-sethsui

A Jellyfin injection script for spotlight slideshow integration.

## Purpose

## Features

- Image and logo slideshows
- Crossfade transitions between slides
- On-screen display (OSD) controls for pause/play, sliders, and icons
- MD3 theme integration for consistent styling
- Historical versions preserved with full backdated commit history

## Usage

1. Place `spotlight.html` and accompanying CSS/JS into a `UI` folder under your Jellyfin web installation (`/jellyfin-web/UI/`).
2. Ensure your API key is set in the script.
3. Restart Jellyfin to load the injected script.
